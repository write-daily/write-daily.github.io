Hey! 

Some friends and I got together to build https://writedaily.co, a website that works off of the Medium platform. After picking a preference between creative, professional or opinionated, we send you a daily prompt for a week. We haven't launched yet, but check out https://wirte-daily.github.io for a sneak peek. 

I really liked a couple of your /r/writingprompts responses, and was hoping you'd agree to be one of the people prepopulating our platform (we have a feeling people would be less inclined to sign up if there were no existing responses). 

I would be eternally grateful if you picked one of the prompts below and respond to it. I know how it feels to be an artist being asked to do things for "exposure"; so I don't want to put you in that position. Since I'm just a college kid doing this for fun/free, I don't have much money, but I'd be happy to throw 20 bucks your way if that meant the difference between a response or not. Please respond with a response (or a refusal), and definitely feel free to plug your subreddit/wesbite/writing. 

One morning you wake up and discover a new superpower.
